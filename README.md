Hi there! üëã

I'm a senior software engineer, primarily working in the .NET and NodeJs ecosystem.

Things I talk about on LinkedIn:

- Software engineering and architecture 
- Distributed systems and how to build them
- Databases and optimization techniques
- Career and personal growth
- Team Leadership

One of my goals is to become a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies.

If this sounds interesting, let's connect!
